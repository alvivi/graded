//// Tests for topological-order project module inference. These exercise the
//// regression from the original issue (deep transitive chains needing
//// multiple `graded infer` runs to converge) and a few related shapes.
////
//// Fixtures are materialised at runtime under `/tmp/` so the Gleam compiler
//// doesn't try to compile them as project modules — fixture modules import
//// each other (e.g. `import app/d`) which would not resolve from `test/`.
//// All temp directories start without any `.graded` files, which also
//// exercises Risk 2 ("modules without prior .graded files still get
//// processed").
