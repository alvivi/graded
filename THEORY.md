# Theory behind assay

This document explains the mathematical foundations that assay uses to check effects in Gleam programs. No prior knowledge of type theory is assumed — we build up from simple ideas to the full picture.

## The core question

Given a function like this:

```gleam
pub fn view(model: Model) -> Element(Msg) {
  html.div([], [
    html.h1([], [html.text(model.title)]),
    html.p([], [html.text(model.body)]),
  ])
}
```

How do we *prove* that `view` is pure — that it performs no side effects?

A human can read the code and see it only calls `html.div`, `html.h1`, `html.p`, and `html.text`, which are all pure. But we want a machine to verify this, and to catch it when someone later adds `io.println("debugging")` inside `view`.

## Step 1: Effects as labels

The simplest model: assign each function a *label* describing what kind of side effect it performs.

```
io.println    → Stdout
io.print      → Stdout
process.send  → Process
http.get      → Http
list.map      → (nothing)
string.append → (nothing)
```

Functions with no label are pure. Functions with a label have that effect.

## Step 2: Effects as sets

A function might do more than one thing:

```gleam
pub fn log_and_notify(message: String) -> Nil {
  io.println(message)        // Stdout
  http.post(webhook, message) // Http
}
```

So each function has a *set* of effects, not a single label:

```
log_and_notify → {Stdout, Http}
view           → {}           (empty set = pure)
io.println     → {Stdout}
list.map       → {}
```

This is where set theory enters. The effect of a function is the **union** of the effects of everything it calls:

```
effects(log_and_notify) = effects(io.println) ∪ effects(http.post)
                        = {Stdout} ∪ {Http}
                        = {Stdout, Http}
```

## Step 3: Checking is subset inclusion

When you write an annotation like:

```
check view : []
```

You're declaring: "the effects of `view` must be a subset of the empty set."

The checker computes the actual effects by walking the function body, then checks:

```
actual_effects(view) ⊆ declared_effects(view)
```

If `view` calls `io.println`, then:

```
{Stdout} ⊆ {}  →  false  →  VIOLATION
```

If `view` only calls pure functions:

```
{} ⊆ {}  →  true  →  OK
```

A more permissive annotation works too:

```
check handle_request : [Http, Stdout]
```

This allows `handle_request` to perform Http and Stdout effects, but nothing else:

```
{Http} ⊆ {Http, Stdout}  →  true  →  OK
{Http, Db} ⊆ {Http, Stdout}  →  false  →  VIOLATION (Db not allowed)
```

## Step 4: Why this is a semiring

The mathematical structure underneath is a **semiring** — a set with two operations that interact nicely. For effects:

| Concept | Math | Effects meaning |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Elements | Sets of labels | `{}`, `{Stdout}`, `{Http, Db}` |
| "Addition" (⊕) | Set union (∪) | Combining effects: if f has {A} and g has {B}, calling both gives {A, B} |
| "Multiplication" (⊗) | Set intersection (∩) | Sequencing/composition (used in more advanced checking) |
| Zero (𝟎) | Empty set {} | No effects — pure |
| One (𝟏) | Universal set | All effects — unrestricted |

The semiring laws guarantee that effect composition is well-behaved:

- **Union is associative**: `(A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)` — grouping doesn't matter
- **Union is commutative**: `A ∪ B = B ∪ A` ��� order doesn't matter
- **Empty set is identity**: `A ∪ {} = A` — calling a pure function adds no effects
- **Union is idempotent**: `A ∪ A = A` — calling the same effect twice doesn't create a new kind of effect

These aren't arbitrary axioms — they're exactly what you'd expect from combining effects. If function `f` does Http and function `g` does Http, calling both still only gives you Http as an effect *kind* (though it happens twice).

## Step 5: Transitive analysis

Consider:

```gleam
pub fn view(model: Model) -> Element(Msg) {
  render_header(model)
}

fn render_header(model: Model) -> Element(Msg) {
  io.println("rendering header")  // oops!
  html.h1([], [html.text(model.title)])
}
```

The effect of `view` isn't just its direct calls — it's everything reachable transitively:

```
effects(render_header) = {Stdout}
effects(view) = effects(render_header) = {Stdout}
```

Assay follows local function calls recursively, with cycle detection (via a visited set) to handle mutual recursion:

```gleam
fn a() { b() }
fn b() { a() }  // cycle — detected, not infinite loop
```

## Step 6: The bigger picture — graded modal types

Effects are just one instance of a more general framework called **graded modal type theory**. The key insight: many properties of programs can be described by "how much" or "what kind" of some resource is used, and these quantities form algebraic structures.

| Property | Algebra | Elements | "Zero" | Composition |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Effects** | Set semiring | `{Stdout, Http, ...}` | `{}` (pure) | Union |
| **Privacy** | Lattice | `Public, Internal, Confidential, Secret` | `Public` | Join (max) |

The checker algorithm is the same shape for both:

1. Walk the syntax tree
2. Collect the "grade" (effect set or privacy level) for each operation
3. Combine grades using the algebra's composition operation
4. Check that the result satisfies the declared constraint

This is what makes the theory powerful — the checker is parameterized by the algebra. The same infrastructure that walks the AST and follows transitive calls works for both effects and privacy.

## Step 7: Privacy — the next checker

Effects answer "what *kind* of side effect does this function perform?" Privacy answers "where does sensitive data *flow*?"

Consider a web app that handles user data:

```gleam
pub fn render_profile(user: User) -> Element(Msg) {
  html.div([], [
    html.h1([], [html.text(user.name)]),
    html.p([], [html.text(user.email)]),  // PII!
  ])
}

pub fn log_request(user: User, path: String) -> Nil {
  io.println("Request: " <> path <> " by " <> user.email)  // PII in logs!
}
```

The second function leaks PII into stdout — a real compliance problem (GDPR, HIPAA). The type system can't catch this because `user.email` is just a `String`.

Privacy checking assigns sensitivity levels that form a *lattice*:

```
Secret > Confidential > Internal > Public
```

The rule: data at level L must not flow to a context at level < L.

```
// priv/assay/app.assay
privacy user.email : Confidential
privacy io.println : Public
```

If `log_request` passes `user.email` (Confidential) to `io.println` (Public):

```
Confidential ≤ Public  →  false  →  VIOLATION
```

Unlike effect checking (which walks the call graph), privacy checking requires **data flow analysis** — tracking which variables carry sensitive data and where those values end up. This is a meaningful step up in complexity but uses the same algebra-parametric framework.

## What assay implements today

Assay implements **effect checking** with higher-order and type-aware resolution:

- Effects are sets of string labels
- Composition is set union
- Checking is subset inclusion
- Transitive analysis follows local calls with cycle detection
- Knowledge base maps external functions to their effect sets
- **Parameter bounds** for higher-order functions: `effects apply(f: [Stdout]) : [Stdout]` — calls to bounded parameters use the declared effect set
- **Type field annotations**: `type Handler.on_click : [Dom]` — field access calls on typed parameters resolve effects via the type field registry

Privacy checking is the planned next step — it introduces a new algebra (lattices) and a new analysis mode (data flow) while reusing the existing AST infrastructure.

## A note on other graded properties

The theory supports additional graded properties like **linearity** (tracking how many times a value is used, via natural number semirings) and **capabilities** (tracking permissions, via set semirings). These are well-studied in the literature and the framework can accommodate them.

In practice, for Gleam specifically:
- **Linearity** provides limited value because Gleam is already immutable with no shared state — the language design prevents the bugs linearity would catch.
- **Capabilities** as a set-based check are structurally identical to effects — you can already use effect labels like `[Admin, Write]` for this purpose today.

The focus is on effects and privacy as the two checkers with clear, distinct value for Gleam programs.
