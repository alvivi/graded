and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Catalog entry for `gleam_time` (all modules pure; `system_time`, `local_offset`, `utc_offset` marked `[Time]`).
- Catalog entry for `houdini` (fully pure).
- Automatic effect inference for path dependencies declared in `gleam.toml`. Functions from local path deps are now inferred from source instead of being marked `[Unknown]`.
- Path dependency inference loads existing `.graded` files for parameter bounds, improving accuracy for higher-order functions.
- Two-pass inference for path dependencies so cross-dep calls resolve correctly.

### Fixed

- Record constructors (`Ok`, `Error`, `Some`, custom types) no longer inferred as `[Unknown]`. Gleam constructors start with an uppercase letter and are always pure.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-04

### Added

- Effect checker for Gleam via sidecar `.graded` annotation files.
- `graded check` command to enforce `check` annotations.
- `graded infer` command to infer and write `effects` annotations.
- `graded format` command with `--check` and `--stdin` modes.
- Higher-order effect tracking with parameter bounds.
- Field call effect tracking with type-aware resolution.
- External effect declarations for third-party functions.
- Wildcard effect `[_]` as the universal top element.
- Warnings for function references passed as values with known effects.
- Versioned catalog system resolved against `manifest.toml`.
- Catalog entries for `gleam_stdlib`, `gleam_erlang`, `gleam_otp`, `gleam_http`, `gleam_httpc`, `gleam_json`, `gleam_regexp`, `gleam_yielder`, `gleam_crypto`, `lustre`, `lustre_http`, `simplifile`, `filepath`, `tom`.
